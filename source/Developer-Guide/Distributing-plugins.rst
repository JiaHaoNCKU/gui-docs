Distributing plugins
=====================

This page contains instructions for preparing plugins for distribution through the Open Ephys Plugin Installer. Currently, only members of the core Open Ephys team are allowed to do this.

1. Fork the plugin to the :code:`open-ephys-plugins` account (requires logging in to the account).

2. Add GitHub workflows

.. note:: Coming soon.
